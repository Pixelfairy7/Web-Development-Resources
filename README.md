# Erika's Hopefully Helpful && Organized  List of Web Development Resources

This repo serves to organize the many bookmarks I have used/read/discovered over my path to becoming a front end developer. My hope is that this will be easier to maintain than a bunch of bookmarked folders and also as a resource to anyone looking to get started in Web Development or just to learn a new skill. If you have any contributions please submit a PR (Web development or UX/Design resources for now )! :smiley: Any inclusion of any resource is strictly voluntary and I recieve nothing for recommending anything paid or otherwise.
